# Mortgage-Prediction
This project demonstrates the process of predicting loan eligibility for single family houses. Specifically, I investigated the conventional loan using Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data in Oakland County, Michigan.

There are three files in this repository:

1. README.md: This file
2. Oakland County Mortgage Prediction: The actual work of this project
3. Oakland_county_hmda_2023.csv: Data set used for the model and verification. The code assumes that this file is located in the same location as the notebook.
